# Project1
 
1. Make sure you have read the project specification thoroughly.
2. Make sure you had GitHub create a private version of this repository by following the link on BeachBoard. If this repository is called `csulb-cecs475-2017sp/Project1` (without your name at the end), then you are in the wrong place.
3. Clone your repository to your desktop.
4. Implement the project!
5. When ready to test, push your changes to GitHub, then wait 5-10 minutes to receive an email from the grading robot.

Good luck >:).
